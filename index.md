## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Wisconsin, Madison. I am advised by Prof. [Ramya Korlakai Vinayak](https://ramyakv.github.io/), Prof. [Matthew L. Malloy](https://www.mattmalloy.org/) and Prof. ‪[Steven J. Schrodi](https://genetics.wisc.edu/staff/schrodi-steven/). 

My research interests lie in machine learning/deep learning theory and application. My previous research areas include self-supervised learning, out-of-distribution detection, active learning, A/B testing, and AI in biomedical fields. I also have strong interest in abstract algebra and cryptography.
