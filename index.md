## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Mathematics from University of Wisconsin, Madison. I am a research assistant in Machine Learning and Optimization Theory ([MLOPT](https://mlopt.ece.wisc.edu/)) Research Group. I am advised by Prof. [Ramya Korlakai Vinayak](https://ramyakv.github.io/), Prof. [Matthew L. Malloy](https://www.mattmalloy.org/) and Prof. ‪[Steven J. Schrodi](https://genetics.wisc.edu/staff/schrodi-steven/). 

My research interests lie in machine learning/deep learning. My previous research areas include computer vision, out-of-distribution detection, active learning, A/B testing, and computational biology. I also have strong interest in abstract algebra and cryptography.

## Hobbies

I play basketball in my free time. I am doing a heavy leg train to learn to dunk. I watch NBA -- 10 years Memphis Grizzlies fan! I enjoy cooking. I have no hesitation in trying different recipes of bubble tea.
